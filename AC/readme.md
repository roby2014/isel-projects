# AC

### Info
* Language used: P16 Assembly (ARM based)

## AC Laboratory
Those are laboratory tasks, not evaluation projects.
Usually writing things in C first then converting it to assembly makes our life easier.

* [lab01](https://github.com/robyzzz/isel-projects/tree/master/AC/lab01/) : Multiplication of two natural numbers, using the consecutive sums algorithm [[Task](https://github.com/robyzzz/isel-projects/tree/master/AC/lab01/ac_lab01.pdf)] [[Code](https://github.com/robyzzz/isel-projects/tree/master/AC/lab01/)]
## AC Projects
Evaluation projects

* [project01](https://github.com/robyzzz/isel-projects/tree/master/AC/project01/) : Temperature average in assembly 
[[Task](https://github.com/robyzzz/isel-projects/tree/master/AC/project01/ac_trab01.pdf)]
