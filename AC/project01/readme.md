# Project 01

This work has as main objectives the exercise of programming in assembly language of the P16 processor, including the organization of programs in routines and the exploration of a programming environment in this language.

The work consists in the development and testing of a program to calculate average values ​​of air temperature, involving i) operations with integers, ii) manipulation of arrays in memory, iii) invocation of functions and iv) use of variables in memory.

The program to be developed must be written in P16 assembly language, respecting all the rules of the P16 convention for the use of routines, and its test must be carried out using the P16 simulator.
