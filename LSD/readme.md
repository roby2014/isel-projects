# LSD projects
### All the projects use VHDL and ModelSim

### Info
* lab* - Practice projects (some of them are required for the evaluation projects)
* tlab* - Evaluation projects
* The project tasks are described in the files which end in <i>*_Enunciado.pdf</i>
* The project reports are the files which end in <i>*_relatorio.pdf</i>

I would suggest to <b>NOT</b> rely on the reports (<i>*_relatorio.pdf</i>), because it can have misleading information and bad practices. :rofl:
